# Approach
* load a CSV dataset and make it available to Keras.
* create a neural network model with Keras for a regression problem.
* use scikit-learn with Keras to evaluate models using cross-validation.
<!-- 
* perform data preparation in order to improve skill with Keras models.
* tune the network topology of models with Keras.
-->

# How to use this example?
* run the fetch_data.py to fetch data
* run the application.py to run the example
